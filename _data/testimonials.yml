His knowledge and willingness to make it the way we wanted was evident every day. He was always on top of things and kept the project moving. He also works with great people who know their business. One of Don’s biggest assets is his ability to work with people and his diplomatic attitude. If we ever build again, we certainly would want to have Don as our builder.
